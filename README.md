### Hi there! My name is JessicaðŸ‘‹ (Or you could call me JðŸ¤­) 
I am an aspiring data scientist, with industrial experience as an analytical chemist. 
I have had an interest in the world of data for a good couple of years, but recently have decided to take the plunge and start learning how to get started in this industry.
Any tips, tricks, advice or criticism would be appreciated!
- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on a beginners Python coding project.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use Python and some basic statistics.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with the best way to learn how to code, and how to know which skills are most important when trying to land a role as a data scientist.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my interests, anything related to the chemical field, or music! (I could go on forever about the last one... so maybe not!)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Slide me a message on LinkedIn!
